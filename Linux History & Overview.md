**Linux is not an operating system**
**Linux is an open-source kernel**
A Kernel is the core part of an operating system, managing system resources and communication between hardware and software. 
Kernel acts as the engine(core part). So the engine remains the open source, and using this engine many other distributions are made. And this Distributions or Distros are an operating system. And **Linux Distros are operating system** made from a software collection, which includes the Linux Kernel and often a package management system.
